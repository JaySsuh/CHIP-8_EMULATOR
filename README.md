# CHIP-8_EMULATOR
A simple CHIP-8 emulator that follows the instructions from [this](https://austinmorlan.com/posts/chip8_emulator) site. It is a stepping stone for me to eventually create more complex emulator for larger and more sophisticated machines such as an NES device, and eventually an emulator that simulates an original PlayStation. I was originally going to create an emulator for the DS so I can play my childhood games, however, the internet has told me that I should start with something simple such as a CHIP-8 emulator, so this is where I will begin. Austin Morlan has been the most helpful website that has directions in creating a CHIP-8 emulator, as he not only includes the instructions for the code and how I should go about it, but also explanations for me so I can deeply understand the code that I am writing. Anyone can code, however, it takes a real programmer to understand the how and the why of what they are creating.
